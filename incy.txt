Spiderman Spiderman does whatever a spider can
spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies
Look out, here comes the Spiderman
Is he strong listen bud, He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead
Hey,there! There goes the Spiderman
Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
Incy Wincy Spider bounced up the water spout
Down came the rain and spat the spider out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider bounced up the spout again
HELLO
