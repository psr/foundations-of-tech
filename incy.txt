Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again

But once again, the rain returned
And Mr Spiders world was upturned
When will it end?
Hopefully round the next bend.
