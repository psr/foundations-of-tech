Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
Incy Wincy Spider went up the water spout
He went to https://open.spotify.com/artist/7fJOLOLjMxFn0Rft2qFoKX and checked the music out 
"Oh my god it's great!" He exclaimed out loud
And went about his day feeling very very proud
