Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
<<<<<<< HEAD
Incy wincy spider climbed up the tree
Down came the tree and crushed the spider flat
=======
<<<<<<< HEAD
Incy Wincy Spider went up the water spout
He went to https://open.spotify.com/artist/7fJOLOLjMxFn0Rft2qFoKX and checked the music out 
"Oh my god it's great!" He exclaimed out loud
And went about his day feeling very very proud
=======
Spider-man, Spider-man, does whatever a spider can
Spider-pig, Spider-pig, does whatever a spider-pig does

Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout

Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again

Then the rain came back
as Mr Spider's thread went slack
What is a spider to do?
Honestly, I haven't a clue 

Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again


HELLO
Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
creep mouse creep mouse
up to the knee
creep a little further
wee wee wee wee wee
Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout,
Down came the rain and washed the spider out,
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain,
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again!

But once again, the rain returned
And Mr Spiders world was upturned
When will it end?
Hopefully round the next bend.





bah bah black sheep

Spiderman Spiderman does whatever a spider can
spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies
Look out, here comes the Spiderman
Is he strong listen bud, He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread? Take a look overhead
Hey,there! There goes the Spiderman

Incy Wincy Spider climed up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again
